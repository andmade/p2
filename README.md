#Description
This project is an xkcd-style password generator. It is based off the videogame "Persona 3" and uses the summons/"personas" that belong to the various Tarot arcana in the game. The code picks a random summon from the user's chosen arcana for each number of words
the user wants in their password. An option is also included to include a symbol and/or number. Server-side error checking is also present.
